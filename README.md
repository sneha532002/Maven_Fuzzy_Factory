Problem Statement
An  e-commerce company face challenge in understanding what drives conversions, customer retention, and product profitability. My goal is to identify and optimize KPIs across the customer journey, from the initial website visit through to purchase and post-purchase behavior.

Key Insights
72% of sessions came from the g_ad_1 campaign, generating 71% of total orders.
The "gsearch nonbrand" source had the highest conversion rate at 6.6%.
Peak traffic occurred between 11 AM and 3 PM, with 78,000 pageviews on average during that time.
Product ID 1 had the highest orders and revenue, while Product ID 2 had the highest average order value.
Product 4 had the highest return rate at 11%, indicating potential product dissatisfaction.

Recommendations
Optimize Paid Campaigns: Increase budget allocation for high-performing UTM campaigns like "g_ad_1" and "b_ad_1." Consider reducing spend on low-conversion campaigns.
Enhance Top Traffic Pages: Improve the user experience on the top 5 entry pages by ensuring fast load times, clear CTAs, and mobile-friendly designs to lower bounce rates.
Leverage Peak Traffic Times: Schedule marketing campaigns (e.g., emails, ads) around the peak traffic hours of 11 AM - 3 PM to capture maximum user engagement.
Focus on High-Margin Products: Promote products with high sales performance and margin while adjusting pricing strategies for low-margin products to increase profitability.
Address High Return Rates: Investigate the causes of high return rates for certain products and take steps to improve product quality or better match customer expectations.

Tools Used
SQL: To extract and analyze the e-commerce data.
